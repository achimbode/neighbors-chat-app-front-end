# neighbors-chat-app-back-end

## Description
This is the front-end for my neighbors chat app. The back end can be found [here](https://github.com/fredpinon/neighbors-chat-app-back-end). The app allows users to find out who is active in their building, sign up and join the building's chat room.

* Run `cd bubble`
* Run `npm install`
